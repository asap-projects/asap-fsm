### Features

* initial version ([0b89372](http://github.com/abdes/asap/commit/0b893726ab41f7454d5fd1618d0be8f6a92cca43))

  The `fsm` module provides a template-based framework for implementing
  finite state machines in C++. States, their transitions and event
  handlers are statically typed for maximum compile-time enforcement
  of the valid transitions.
